# Saving Superstore Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Superstore Data Visualization Project! The superstore is facing a crisis, and your insights will guide them away from bankruptcy. This README details the methods and findings of the project, following the provided rubric to ensure a fair and consistent evaluation.

### Datasets
- `Superstore.xls`

## Evaluation Rubric
This project adheres to a specific rubric designed to evaluate the analysis fairly and consistently, covering specific steps to complete analysis.

## Project Objective
The primary goal is to analyze the Superstore's operations and propose strategies to increase profitability. The project is divided into three parts, focusing on profits & losses, advertising effectiveness, and analyzing returned items.

### Part 1: Profits & Losses
The first part of the analysis focuses on identifying key areas of profit and loss.

#### Tasks:
1. **Identify Profit Centers**: Determine the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers among various dimension pairs (e.g., subcategory + region). Justify with visualizations.
2. **Product Analysis**: Identify which products the superstore should stop selling and which subcategories to focus on or drop. Justify with visualizations.

### Part 2: Advertising
This section evaluates the potential benefits of advertising and identifies optimal advertising opportunities.

#### Tasks:
1. **Best Advertising Combos**: Identify the 3 best combinations of states and months for advertising. Provide visualizations of the average profit for each month and state.
2. **Ad Spend Ratio**: Discuss the willingness to pay for advertisements based on the return on ad spend ratio, considering spending 1/5 of profits on advertising.

### Part 3: Returned Items
The final part focuses on the analysis of returned items and their impact on the superstore's profitability.

#### Tasks:
1. **Return Rate Analysis**: Convert the 'Returned' field into a calculated field and analyze which products and customers have the highest return rates.
2. **Profit vs. Return Rate**: Create a visualization showing the average profit against the average return rate for a chosen dimension. Present an argument for or against continuing business in this dimension based on the analysis.

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation**: The datasets were cleaned, and relevant fields were prepared, including the transformation of the 'Returned' field.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau was used to create data visualization and stories to present findings.
- **Analytical Approach**: Each part of the project was approached with specific analytical methods suited to the question at hand.

### Key Insights:
1. **Profits & Losses**: The West and East regions, and the copiers, phones, and accesories subcategories, were the most profitable. The Central and South regions, and the tables, bookcases, and supplies subcategories were the least profitable or negatively profitable.
2. **Advertising**: The three highest profit states and months are Indiana in October, Vermont in November, and Washington in March.
3. **Returned Items**: The products with the highest return rates are Advantus Push Pins, Global Task Chair, and Global Executive Tilter. And same-day shipping has the highest rate of return among the shipping modes, but it also has the highest profitability.

## Conclusion
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Superstore's operations with actionable insights. By following the recommendations, the Superstore can aim to increase its profitability and secure its future.
